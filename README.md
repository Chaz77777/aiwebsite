# AI Club — Static HTML/CSS Site

This repository contains a simple, responsive website built with only HTML and CSS. It includes three pages:

- `index.html` — Home page
- `about/index.html` — About page
- `about/directory.html` — Directory page under About

External links: `Events`, `Contact`, and `Hackville` in the header are external and open in new tabs.

Preview locally with a simple HTTP server (from the repository root):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Notes/next steps:
- Replace placeholder directory cards in `about/directory.html` with real entries.
- If you want a mobile menu that collapses, I can implement a CSS-only hamburger — ask first.

Questions before continuing:
- Do you want specific brand colors, fonts, or imagery from the wireframes applied?
- Would you like a downloadable PDF, contact form, or any other non-HTML/CSS components (note: forms can be added with HTML only but submission needs a backend)?
